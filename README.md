A simple program that generates a bitmap through pseudo-random generation. This can have several uses, such as demonstrating the effectiveness of pseudo-random number generation, pattern recognition in cognitive science, or other personal uses (e.g. for the heck of it).

System Requirements
===================
Windows XP (Service Pack 3), Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 (32-/64-bit)

* .NET Framework 4+ (Client Profile or Full) or Mono 2.8+

Other Systems (Unix/Linux/Mac OS X etc.) (32-/64-bit)

* Mono 2.8+

Dependencies
============
As the program uses .NET Framework 4 (Client), it requires .NET Framework 4 (Client) on Windows-based systems,
and all other systems (e.g. Unix-based) require at least Mono 2.8.
